          The Vision

          There is a question that have always intrigued me : Why can't we have
          specialized search engines ?
          <br />
          As we dive into the future of technology, it appears that the vision
          of "Everything" website seems to be the direction.
          <br />
          I personally do not agree with that, as I believe the internet is a
          vast place, and to enjoy each corner of it, one must not feel lost. A
          responsibility of direction lays upon the shoulders of every creator,
          every website designer, and every service provided online.
          <br />
          As a book lover, I decided to apply this vision applied to something I
          love: books, thus creating a book search engine; and that's how
          Bookologia came to life.

            Hi, i'm Youssef. To fairly present myself, I'm a data and a founding
            engineer, I work with startups to bring their visions into life, and
            sometimes with big corporations to launch MVPs or internal tools.
            <br />
            My way of engineering lays in the cartesian method; I do not take
            anything for granted. Every piece of the systems I create serves a
            purpose, and every tool I use must be used for a purpose, and this
            in itself creates a unique aesthetic of simplicity. Bookologia is
            nothing but that: a clear vision, a clear complex system that does
            one thing and does it right.

          Bookologia is a specialized search engine that indexes and organizes
          links to book-related content retrieved from publicly available
          sources, specifically Google and DuckDuckGo. We do not host, sell,
          distribute, or provide direct access to any books or copyrighted
          material. Our database consists solely of links gathered from these
          search engines. Since Bookologia does not host or control the content
          linked on external sites, we can only remove links from our index upon
          valid copyright requests.

          <br />

          If you believe that a copyrighted work is being unlawfully
          distributed, we recommend taking the following steps:
          <br />

          <br />
          <ol class="list-decimal pl-5">
            <li>
              Contact the website that is hosting the infringing material
              directly and request its removal.
            </li>
            <li>
              Submit a copyright complaint to the search engines that index and
              provide access to the content:

          <ul class="list-disc pl-5">
            <li>
              An identification of the copyrighted work(s) or trademark(s) that

            </li>
            <li>
              A declaration that the information provided in your DMCA Notice is

            </li>
          </ul>
          <br />

          Please note that even if we remove a link from our search index, it
          may reappear if the original source remains accessible via general
          search engines such as Google or DuckDuckGo. Our search engine
          database is refreshed every 15 days, meaning that if infringing
          content remains publicly indexed by other search engines, it may be
          re-added to our search results. To ensure complete removal, steps (1)
          and (2) should be taken before contacting us. For further
          transparency, our search engine's indexing process is open-source. You
          may review the details of how our system works on our GitHub
